#labels Featured

= Hardware Setup =
- Machine #1, a router - requires two network interfaces and NIST net. For more information on NIST net see, <http://www-x.antd.nist.gov/nistnet/>. IP Table configuration scripts are included with the source code. <br>
- Machine #2, a sender - requires one network interface and Visual Studio 2005.<br>
- Machine #3, a receiver - requires one network interface and Visual Studio 2005.<br>

= Configuration Files =
- 'Control' - This directory stores the results, scenarios, schedules, and test files for the sender and receiver.<br>

(The TestFile location on the sender side does is required to be in the same directory as the binary)

= Third party components =
- QuickHash must be added, see <http://www.slavasoft.com/quickhash/index.htm>.<br>
